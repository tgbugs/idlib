        for identifiers local conventions usually convert
        a local identifer into a globally unique identifier
        by providing some additional context.

        Beyond their use for globalizing local identifiers,
        local conventions are information that an be specified
        dynamically, as part of a single stream and that is
        requried in order to correctly interpret information
        that was originally encoded according to those local
        conventions.  """
